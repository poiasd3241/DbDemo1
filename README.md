# DbDemo1

Short demo focusing on MS SQL Server implementation of the following database functionality:

- Create table,
- Create entry [with user input validation],
- Retrieve entries with unique columns values [full name and date of birth],
- Create 1000000 [random] + 100 [random, male and full name starts with 'F'] entries,
- Retrieve [male and full name starts with 'F'] entries,
- Improve execution time of the previous operation by creating a nonclustered index.
